**How did this go, overall?**

Salmon Cookies as a whole was pretty challenging. I'm glad I got to run into walls and learn how to overcome, or circumvent. 


**What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?**

Well, I noticed that our data never really gets stored anywhere. I'm thinking of a process where coustomer data is collected at the time of sale and location into a database, and we populate our table with that data.


**How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?**

It took me the whole week to complete this assignment. I spent nearly all waking hours thinking about Salmon Cookies. I'm hoping to look back at this time fondly and seeing how far I've grown from week 2 of Code 201.
